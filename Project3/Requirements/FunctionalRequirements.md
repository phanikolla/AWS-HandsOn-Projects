# Functional Requirements Document

**Date:** Tuesday, January 21, 2025, 10 PM IST  
**Purpose:** This document outlines the functional requirements for a web application with two user profiles: **Admins** and **End Users**. The application will feature two pages initially: `/user` for end users and `/admin` for admins.

## Profiles and Pages

### **1. User Profiles**
- **Admin Profile:**  
  Admins have elevated privileges, including content management capabilities.
- **End User Profile:**  
  End users can view and interact with content.

### **2. Pages**
- `/user`: Accessible by end users.
- `/admin`: Accessible by admins.

## Functional Requirements

### **/user Page**
1. Display a list of recipe titles.
2. Allow users to select a specific recipe to view its details.
3. Ensure responsiveness for optimal display on:
   - Tablets
   - Phones
   - Laptops

### **/admin Page**
1. Include all functionalities of the `/user` page.
2. Additional functionalities:
   - Create new recipes.
   - Delete existing recipes.

## Design Requirements

### **UI Design**
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Consistent design across both pages.

### **Responsiveness**
- The application must be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different devices:
  - Use fluid grids and flexible images.
  - Implement CSS media queries for breakpoints (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Mockup Creation

### **Steps to Create Mockups**
1. Choose a mockup tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD, Moqups).
2. Start with wireframes for `/user` and `/admin` pages.
3. Add interactive elements to demonstrate user journeys:
   - Recipe selection on `/user`.
   - Recipe creation and deletion on `/admin`.
4. Test designs on multiple devices to ensure responsiveness.

## Cost Considerations

1. **Mockup Tools**  
   - Free options: Figma (basic plan), Canva, Moqups (limited features).  
   - Paid options: Adobe XD, Axure RP, MockPlus (for advanced features).

2. **Development Costs**  
   - No additional cost if using open-source frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsiveness.
   - Potential hosting costs depending on the deployment platform.

3. **Testing Tools**  
   - Free tools: BrowserStack (trial), Chrome DevTools.
   - Paid tools: BrowserStack (premium), LambdaTest.

## Notes
Creating mockups is a crucial step in visualizing the interface before implementation. Use tools that offer collaboration features for team feedback during the design phase.
