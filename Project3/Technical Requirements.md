# Technical and Data Requirements Document

**Date:** Tuesday, January 21, 2025, 10 PM IST  
**Purpose:** This document outlines the technical and data requirements for the application, ensuring it meets performance, scalability, and maintainability needs.

---

## Technical Requirements

### **1. Frontend**
- **Framework:** React.js  
  - Modern, component-based architecture for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces.
  - Supports reusable components and state management (e.g., Redux or Context API).

### **2. Backend**
- **Programming Language:** Python  
  - Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries.
- **API Framework:** FastAPI  
  - High-performance framework for building RESTful APIs.
  - Built-in support for asynchronous programming to handle high concurrency efficiently.

### **3. Infrastructure**
- Use **AWS Lambda** for serverless backend deployment to ensure scalability and no maintenance overhead.
- Deploy the application using **Amazon API Gateway** to manage API endpoints securely and efficiently.

## Data Requirements

### **1. Data Store**
- **Type:** NoSQL document database (due to unstructured data and no relationships between records).
- **Recommendation:** Amazon DynamoDB  
  - Fully managed, serverless NoSQL database.
  - Scales automatically to handle high throughput (20,000 concurrent users).
  - Low-latency performance (single-digit millisecond response times).

### **2. Recipe Document Structure**
Each recipe will be stored as a JSON document with the following structure:
{
"Id": "GUID",
"Title": "Recipe Title",
"Ingredients": ["Ingredient1", "Ingredient2", "..."],
"Steps": ["Step1", "Step2", "..."]
}


### **3. Operations**
- **List Recipes:** Retrieve all recipe titles.
- **Create Recipe:** Add a new recipe document.
- **Delete Recipe:** Remove a recipe document by its `Id`.

---

## Scalability and Performance

### **1. Data Size Estimation**
- Each recipe is approximately **1KB** in size.
- Assuming up to **20,000 concurrent users**, DynamoDB can handle the workload effectively:
  - Provisioned throughput or On-Demand mode ensures consistent performance during peak hours.

### **2. Performance Consistency**
- DynamoDB's auto-scaling ensures that read/write capacity adjusts dynamically based on traffic patterns.
- Use DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region replication (e.g., USA and UK) to reduce latency for global users.

---

## Cost Considerations

1. **DynamoDB Costs:**
   - On-Demand mode charges based on read/write requests.
   - Storage cost is minimal due to small document size (1KB per recipe).

2. **Serverless Backend:**
   - AWS Lambda charges are based on execution time and number of invocations.
   - API Gateway charges are based on API requests.

3. **Frontend Hosting:**
   - Use AWS Amplify or Amazon S3 + CloudFront for hosting React.js frontend with low costs.

By leveraging serverless technologies and a NoSQL database like DynamoDB, the application will achieve high scalability, performance consistency, and cost efficiency without maintenance overhead.
