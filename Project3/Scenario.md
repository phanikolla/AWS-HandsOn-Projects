# Scenario: Recipe Sharing Application

## Current Situation
- **Hobby**: Cooking and writing recipes in a notebook.
- **Popularity**: Gained 100,000 followers on social media.
- **Problem**:
  - Followers frequently request recipes for items they tried earlier.
  - Searching through the notebook, taking photos, and sending them manually has become unmanageable as the follower count grows.

## Proposed Solution: Cloud-Based Recipe Sharing Application
To address the scalability and efficiency issues, I plan to build a cloud application that makes it easier to share recipes with my followers.

### Key Features of the Application
1. **Recipe Storage**:
   - Store all recipes in a structured format in a database.
   - Include metadata like recipe name, ingredients, preparation time, and tags for easy searching.

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Allow followers to search for recipes by name, ingredients, or tags.

3. **Recipe Sharing**:
   - Provide a user-friendly interface where followers can access and view recipes directly.
   - Enable downloading or sharing links to recipes.

4. **Image Hosting**:
   - Upload images of recipes (e.g., finished dishes) for better presentation.

5. **Authentication**:
   - Allow secure access for followers via login credentials.

### AWS Services to Use
1. **Amazon S3**: 
   - Store static assets like recipe images and frontend files.
2. **Amazon EC2**:
   - Host the backend application logic.
3. **Amazon CloudFront**:
   - Distribute the frontend globally with low latency.
4. **Amazon DynamoDB**:
   - Store and manage structured recipe data (e.g., recipe details, tags).
5. **Amazon Cognito**:
   - Implement user authentication for secure access.

### Deployment Strategy
- Use **AWS CloudFormation** for infrastructure as code to automate resource provisioning.
- Utilize the **AWS Management Console** for configurations and monitoring.

### Benefits of the Solution
- **Scalability**: Easily handle growing follower requests without manual effort.
- **Efficiency**: Recipes can be searched and accessed instantly by followers.
- **Accessibility**: Followers can view recipes anytime from any device.
- **Professionalism**: A dedicated application enhances your brand image.

### Cost Considerations
1. **S3 Costs**: Based on storage size (images, frontend files).
2. **EC2 Costs**: Depends on instance type and usage hours.
3. **CloudFront Costs**: Charged based on data transfer and requests served globally.
4. **DynamoDB Costs**: Charged per read/write capacity unit and data storage.
5. Additional costs may incur for services like Cognito, CloudWatch monitoring, or SSL/TLS certificates via ACM.

This cloud-based solution will simplify recipe sharing, provide a better experience for followers, and allow you to focus on your passion for cooking without being burdened by manual processes.
