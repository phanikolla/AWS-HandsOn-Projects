## Choosing the Right Tool
1. Use the **AWS Console** if:
   - You are new to AWS or prefer a graphical interface.
   - Your tasks are infrequent or require monitoring.

2. Use the **AWS CLI** if:
   - You need to automate repetitive tasks or manage multiple resources efficiently.
   - You are comfortable with command-line interfaces.

3. Use the **AWS SDK** if:
   - You are a developer building applications that interact with AWS services programmatically.
   - You require advanced customization or integration with existing systems.
